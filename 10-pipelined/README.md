# 10 - Pipelined MIPS Processor

> [!CAUTION]
> **Planned:** This module is currently under heavy construction.

### Roadmap to Pipelined Architecture
- [ ] Instruction Fetch (IF) Stage
- [ ] Instruction Decode (ID) Stage / Register File
- [ ] Execution (EX) Stage / ALU
- [ ] Memory Access (MEM) Stage
- [ ] Write Back (WB) Stage
- [ ] **Hazard Detection & Forwarding Unit** (Crucial!)
